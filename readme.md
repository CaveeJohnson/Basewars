# Basewars: Shitcode edition

#### Hello traveler!
You've come here to look at the forks of RGaming BaseWars, however you will be disappointed,
all who have tried to update this steaming pile of shit have killed themselves or given up.
Fortunately for you, there is this updated copy!
You must be overjoyed! Now is the time for me to tell you to **STOP IT.**

#### This must only be used for
	1. Example code for website such as 'shittest code to ever exist, 'how not to code', 'painless suicide methods'
	2. H I S T O R I C A L  P U R P O S E S
	3. Inspiration for gamemode IDEAS: Read **NOT IMPLEMENTATION**

##### Buh buh-ut I'm just a humble server owner!
I hear you cry: Fear not, here's a slightly less shit version from [the basewars 2015 repo](https://github.com/hexahedronic/basewars)
or from scriptfodder if you like that stuff.

Now I know I can't stop you using this, but seriously.
### **DON'T FUCKING USE THIS. IT IS FULL OF SECURITY ISSUES.**

If you care about the changes I made, they are public domain, I relinquish all rights to anything I did here
and if anyone who originally contributed to this wants to sue me or any users
just remember
you have to find a professional code analyst who wont kill themselves while looking at this.
Good luck!
